## [San Diego Adventure](https://github.com/josephmsmith/Python-Games/blob/main/san_diego_adventure.py)

[Version 2](https://github.com/josephmsmith/Python-Games/blob/main/sd_adv_2.py)
Edits were made to optimize code: more efficient, scalable, implementation of dictionaries

[Version 3](https://github.com/josephmsmith/Python-Games/blob/main/sd_adv_3.py)
Edits were made to further optimize code: implementation of Match/Case. Only available in Python V3.10 or higher. 

Allows a user to navigate through a level formatted questionnaire with the end goal of giving them some recommendations on things to do based on where they're at in San Diego. This is the idea:
